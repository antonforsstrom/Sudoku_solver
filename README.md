# Sudoku_solver
A graphical interface for the game Sudoku and a integrated solver for the puzzle. 

1. The sudoku interface allows the user to enter values between 0-9 in the initially empty cells of the sudoku board. 
2. When solving the entered sudoku the solver initially checks if the entered puzzle is solveable according to the rules of sudoku. 
3. If feasible, the solver iterates possible values cell by cell using recursion until solution is found.
